# Rickstatic Recall

Ready to test your brain, Morty? [Play Rickstatic Recall here](https://strong-bonbon-73748c.netlify.app/)!

*Alright, Morty, you want a challenge? Well, you’re in the right place. It’s simple but dangerous, like every other stupid thing we do. You mess it up? *Boom*, game over. But you better believe I’m not going to hold your hand. Welcome to Rickstatic Recall.*

## How to Play

- You’ve got a set of cards, Morty. Flip one card at a time and try not to click the same card twice. You think you can handle that? *Don’t make me laugh, Morty.*
- *If you click the same card twice*— *kaboom*, you're done. The game’s over. It's *game over*, Morty. This isn't a game for the faint of heart.
- Your goal? Don't mess up, and keep track of your score. *See how long you can last, kid. But don’t get cocky.*

## Difficulty Levels

*So you think you’re some kind of genius, huh? Let’s see how you handle these levels, Morty:*

- **Meeseeks** – Yeah, this is the starter level. You’re not even in danger yet. You better not mess this up, Morty. It’s an easy warmup.
- **Schwifty** – *Okay*, you’re starting to feel the heat now. Better keep track of your cards, Morty, or things are gonna get ugly.
- **Gazorpazorp** – *Ha! Now we’re cooking.* This one’s for the semi-competent. If you can’t keep up, you’re in for a real mess. You ready?
- **Interdimensional** – *Woah, Morty, slow down.* You think you’re ready for this madness? Get your brain in gear or you’ll start losing track in ways you can't even imagine.
- **Evil Morty** – *You’re either a genius or a fool, Morty.* This level’s brutal. Mess up once, and it’s like *“Wubba Lubba Dub Dub!”*, you’re done. Don’t say I didn’t warn you.

## Features

- **Characters galore, Morty!** You’ll flip cards with all your favorite *Rick and Morty* characters. Good luck remembering them. You’ll need it.
- **High score tracking** — See if you can beat your own score, but I wouldn’t bet on it. Your memory isn’t exactly… reliable, Morty.
- **Game Over** if you click the same card twice. One mistake, and it’s like *“I’m Pickle Rick!”*, you're done. Game over, Morty.

## WARNING

- **Clicking the same card twice will end the game.** That’s right, Morty. *You* ruin your own fate. *Don’t do it!*

*Disclaimer*: This game was developed by a genius— me, Morty—using some super complex stuff you wouldn’t even understand. But hey, it’s fun, and *I guess that’s what counts in this dimension*. So, get your act together and don’t mess it up, alright?
